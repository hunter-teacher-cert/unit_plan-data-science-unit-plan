*  Data downloaded and stored as:    crime_major_Felony_Data.csv
*	 Steps:
           Download in same directory as Python. Open file then read file
*	 Viewing top and bottom of data frame
*  Viewing summary of the data frame

#2.	Select a subset of data from the data frame?
*	 Selecting one column
*	 Selecting a subset of rows
*	 Selecting a subset of columns and rows.


#3.	Use the data source link below to create a Data Frame for 5 Consecutive Years in Python as shown in class.
