by TEAM MEMBERS

Maxwell Yearwood-----

### General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)

Unit 1 : Data Collection and Preparation takes high school students through 11 steps of data cleaning. At the end of these two weeks,
students are expected to able to apply concepts related to data collection and prepartion as they acquire an appreciation for the 
datification of the world in which they will live and work. This course will be open to students who have completed atleast one AP course
in the following subject disciplines: AP CSA, AP Statistics, or AP Research Seminar.
These 11 steps are:
* Reading Data and Selecting Data,
* Filtering Data and Handling Missing Data, 
* Manipulation and Sorting Data,
* Grouping and Rearranging Data, 
* Ranking and Plotting Data, and 
* Data Preparation

### Motivation for Unit
(why have you decided to make this?)

This course has been designed to fulfill two groups of related student needs. First, it is expected that an Introduction to Data Science
will help students to appreciate how various subject areas can be brought together to create new insights. Students have been exposed to various subject areas in isolation which results in the thinking that there is no connection between them. Another, motivation is to provide students with the skill sets that they are likely to need for college and the real-world in which they are expected to live.
